README

The codes for machine learning using three different feature engineerings:

'do_1.m'   The descriptive statistics for Betti numbers and barcodes
'do_2.m'   PI of pure structure
'do_3.m'   The degree distribution of graph (1-dimensional VR complex)
'do_4.m'   The spectral information of graph (1-dimensional VR complex)

The codes for training with the optimal models

'training_1.m'   The descriptive statistics for Betti numbers and barcodes
'training_2.m'   PI of pure structure
'training_3.m'   The degree distribution of graph (1-dimensional VR complex)
'training_4.m'   The spectral information of graph (1-dimensional VR complex)


The menu for saving the machine leaning results:

'results/'


The code for PCA:

pca_.m


The menu for saving the hyperparameter settings of optimal models:

'models/'


The original dataset:

'data/'


The dataset after PCA:

'data_pca/'


Platform: MATLAB R2022a

The slurm script should be written as:

#SBATCH --nodes=1
#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=8
#SBATCH --mem-per-cpu=3700
#SBATCH --time=48:00:00

module load MATLAB/2022a

cd 'working directory'
matlab -nodisplay -nosplash -nodesktop -r 'cd("working directory");run("do_1.m")'

The working directory refers to the absolute path of the directory where do_1.m is located.


Please remember: the training is platform-related.
